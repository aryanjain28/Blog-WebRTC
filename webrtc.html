        Navigating the WebRTC Wonderworld: Exploring Peer-to-Peer Magic✨
      </div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        Have you ever wondered how video calls magically happen in your browser?
        <br /><br />
        I recently developed a project where I explored in-depth about what
        WebRTC is and how does it actually works.
        <br /><br />
        I will try to explain everything about it here in plain english! I hope
        you like reading it. :)
        <br /><br />
        Ready? Let's go!

      <div id="majorHeading">What is WebRTC?</div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        WebRTC stands for <u>Web Real-Time Communication</u>. It's like the
        internet's way of saying, "Hey, let's have a direct conversation without
        any middlemen!" ✨

        <br /><br />

        In simpler terms, WebRTC lets you make video and audio calls, share
        files, and even play games with your friends in real-time, all straight
        from your web browser. No need to download extra apps or plugins! 🚀🌐

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img4.webp" width="300" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        WebRTC is the "behind-the-scenes" wizardry that connects your browser
        directly to your friends' browsers, creating a
        <b><i>peer-to-peer</i></b> connection. 🧙‍♂️🔗

        <br /><br />

        Now, let's understand what a peer is and what is a peer-to-peer
        connection?
      </div>

      <div id="majorHeading">What is Peer-to-Peer Connection?</div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        Alright, let's dive into the world of "peers" and "peer-to-peer"
        connections! 🌐🤗

        <br /><br />

        Imagine you and your friend are having a secret chat. In this techy
        scenario, you and your friend are like peers. 👫🌟 Each of you has equal
        powers, and you can talk directly to each other without any middle
        person getting in the way. It's like having a private conversation in a
        crowded room! 🗣️🔒

        <br /><br />

        Now, let's apply this idea to the digital realm. In the magical land of
        the internet, devices like your computer or smartphone can also be
        peers. 🖥️📱 And when these devices connect directly to each other to
        share information without bothering servers or intermediaries, that's
        what we call a peer-to-peer (P2P) connection! 🌐🔗

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img5.jpeg" width="400" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        These connections are super handy for things like video calls, online
        gaming, and sharing files quickly. It's like having a digital
        walkie-talkie with your pals. 📞🎮📁 And the best part? Peer-to-peer
        connections can be faster and more private since your data takes the
        express route between you and your buddy. 🚀🔒

        <br /><br />

        Simple right?
        <i>Let's dive a little more</i>
        <br />
        Its important to understand a few things quickly before moving on. I'll
        briefly list them down.
        <br /><br />
        <i style="font-size: 12px">
          There are tons of resources available on the internet to read for each
          of them :)
        </i>

        <br /><br />
        1. <u>Offer</u>: When two devices want to connect, one generates an
        invitaion called offer for the other device and sends it. Another device
        recieves this offer and generates an answer for the first device that
        includes the communication details.

        <br /><br />
        This is called a handshake.

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img2.jpeg" width="300" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        2. <u>Singaling</u>: To exchange the offers and answers, and sort of
        complete the handshake, we need a something called a "Singaling-Server".
        It basically lets them share details of offer and answer via a seperate
        mechanism.

        <br /><br />

        3. <u>ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)</u>: ICE Servers
        helps devices discover the best way to communicate, especially if
        they're behind different network obstacles.

        <br /><br />

        4. <u>STUN and TURN Servers</u>: Direct connections are tricky due to
        obvious network restrictions. To tackle this we have something called
        STUN and NAT. Without going much into details, STUN servers reveals the
        public addresses, and TURN acts as a relay.

            <img src="img3.gif" width="300" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <i style="font-size: 12px"
          >If that was difficult to understand, don't worry! most of these
          things are pretty easy to implement and handled internally.</i

      <div id="majorHeading">Types of network between P2P:</div>
      <div id="mainBody">
        Imagine a lot of users connecting at once (like a zoom meeting). How
        would each user connect to every other user? Is there any sort of
        structure?
        <br /><br />
        Yes! Mainly, there are 3 types:
        <br /><br />

        1. MESH
        <br /><br />
        In a MESH network, devices directly connect to every other device in a
        web-like structure. Imagine a bunch of friends at a party, all chatting
        with each other. It's a decentralized setup where each device is a peer,
        ensuring direct communication between participants. However, it can get
        pretty overwhelming and inefficient as the party gets bigger.

          <center>
            <img src="img7.png" width="400" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        2. MCU (Multipoint Control Unit) 🎛️:
        <br /><br />
        Picture a party with a charismatic host. An MCU is like that host,
        managing the connections and mixing audio and video streams from
        participants. It's useful for larger gatherings, but like a host
        juggling conversations, it can become a bottleneck if the number of
        participants skyrockets.

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img8.png" width="400" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        3. SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)
        <br /><br />
        Imagine a chatroom where only relevant messages are broadcasted. An SFU
        does this for media streams. It receives all the streams and selectively
        forwards them to the right participants. This way, it's like having
        separate dance floors at the party, each catering to a different groove.

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img6.png" width="400" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>
      </div>

        And with that, dear reader, we've uncovered the captivating world of
        WebRTC! 🌐🎉 From its spellbinding peer-to-peer connections that whisk
        your conversations across continents, to its magical media streaming
        that turns your voice and video into virtual wonders, WebRTC has truly
        transformed the way we connect online. 🧙‍♂️💬✨
